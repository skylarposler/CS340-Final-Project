            Welcome to OneStop Anime, your one stop streaming platform to all your favorite        anime! Browse the available 3rd party platforms, titles, subscriptions, host            domains and customers by using the menu above. </p>

            <p>By having a membership to OneStop, viewers can access and stream anime from             other streaming platforms through premium subscriptions. These premium                  subscriptions include Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, and              HiDive.   Members of OneStop can pick and choose which platforms they want to           subscribe to and our service will bundle and display all of the anime content           from their platforms. Each subscription will cost as much as their platform's           premium subscription + our website's service fee. Our service increases                 convenience and utility. Instead of navigating through countless titles that a          user has no interest in, only anime titles will be displayed on our site. Having        all of the desired content consolidated in one place will save the user from            digging through each individual platform searching for the right title.</p>
